#+title: On the prevalence of early mass transfer for very massive binaries

In the manuscript, to be submitted to RNAAS, we compare [[https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/][MESA]]
models with overshooting parameters informed by observations in the
relevant mass range with models without overshooting and the stellar
models used in rapid binary population synthesis obtained using [[https://github.com/TeamCOMPAS/COMPAS][COMPAS]].

We show that for very large initial masses, the radial evolution
during the main sequence can lead to significant changes in the number
of systems experiencing early case A vs. late case B mass transfer,
with potential implications for post-mass-transfer binary systems.

See the compiled [[./mass_transfer_proportions_1312.pdf][manuscript]] and the [[][input, output, and scripts on zenodo]].
