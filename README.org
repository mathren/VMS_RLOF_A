In the [[./on-the-prevalence-of-early-mass-transfer-for-very-massive-binaries.pdf][manuscript]], submitted to RNAAS, we compare [[https://docs.mesastar.org/en/latest/][MESA]] models with
overshooting parameters informed by observations in the relevant mass
range with models without overshooting and the stellar models used in
rapid binary population synthesis obtained using [[https://github.com/TeamCOMPAS/COMPAS][COMPAS]].

We show that for very large initial masses, the radial evolution
during the main sequence can lead to significant changes in the number
of systems experiencing early case A vs. late case B mass transfer,
with potential implications for post-mass-transfer binary systems.

We provide a [[https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14757819][reproducibility package on zenodo]] containing input and
output of the simulations and scripts to create the figure.
